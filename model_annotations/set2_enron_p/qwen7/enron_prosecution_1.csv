17,17,Q/A,"Now, when you entered into this plea of guilty, had you been informed that there was a substantial amount of incriminating evidence against you?",I knew there - nobody had to have the other evidence. I knew it myself.,enron_prosecution_1,"DEFENSE: Now, when you entered into this plea of guilty, had you been informed that there was a substantial amount of incriminating evidence against you?
","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the defense asked the witness: ""Now, when you entered into this plea of guilty, had you been informed that there was a substantial amount of incriminating evidence against you?"" The witness replied, ""I knew there - nobody had to have the other evidence. I knew it myself.""

Alright, let's tackle each property one by one.

1. **Commitment Level**: The witness responded directly to the question, saying they knew about the evidence. This shows they're committed to the truth because they acknowledged their knowledge. So, it's a 2, Beneficial commitment.

2. **Truthfulness**: The response seems truthful. They admitted knowing about the evidence, which aligns with the question asked. So, it's a 1.

3. **Consistency**: The witness's current response is consistent with their previous testimony. If they've given similar answers before, this makes sense. So, 0.

4. **Relevance**: The response directly addresses the question about the plea agreement and incriminating evidence. It's very relevant, so 1.

5. **Clarity**: The response is clear, but there's a slight hedging with ""nobody had to have the other evidence."" That's a bit unclear, so maybe a 2.

6. **Outcome**: The witness spoke, so the outcome is Witness.

7. **Reason for Outcome**: The witness provided a truthful and relevant answer, so it's about truthfulness and relevance, not a credibility attack or emotional appeal.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is truthful, consistent, relevant, and clear enough. So, they're the winner of the current turn.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me go through each property one by one to understand how to assess the witness's testimony.

First, the commitment level. The defense is asking if the witness was informed about incriminating evidence when they entered a plea of guilty. The witness responds, ""I knew there - nobody had to have the other evidence. I knew it myself."" This seems like a direct admission of knowing about the evidence, which could be a strong commitment. Commitment level 2, which is beneficial, because the witness is stating that they knew about the evidence, which might be relevant to their plea.

Next, truthfulness. The witness says they knew about the evidence, which is a straightforward answer. There's no indication of lies or evasions, so this should be truthful. Truthfulness score 1.

Consistency with previous testimony. The witness has given similar responses before, talking about their guilty plea and the evidence they knew about. Their current answer aligns with previous statements, so consistency score 0.

Response relevance. The question was about whether the witness was informed about incriminating evidence when entering a plea. The response directly addresses that, so it's very relevant. Relevance score 1.

Response clarity. The witness's answer is clear and direct. They didn't use any hedging or unclear language. Clarity score 1.

Current turn outcome. The witness is answering the question, so the outcome is witness. Outcome_value is ""Witness.""

Outcome reason. The witness's response is direct and truthful, so it's based on truthfulness and clarity. Reason 1, logical arguments are convincing, but since the witness is answering directly, it's more about clarity and truthfulness.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is truthful, consistent, relevant, and clear. The defense's question was about incriminating evidence, and the witness admitted to knowing about it, which is a strong point. So the witness's response is very convincing, and the defense's case is supported by this admission.

","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me go through each property one by one.

First, the witness's commitment level. The question was about whether the witness was committed to the statement that the evidence was cited here, yes. The witness responded, ""They're cited here, yes. I wished that was all I did."" I think the witness is trying to downplay the significance of the cited evidence by saying they only did that. So, maybe they're not committed to the statement because they're trying to minimize their role. That might be a 2, Neutral commitment.

Next, truthfulness. The witness said they wished the evidence was all they did. That seems a bit self-serving, but it's not outright lies. So maybe it's 1, truthful, but with some hedging.

Consistency: The witness previously mentioned that they were guilty of aiding and abetting securities fraud and didn't plead guilty to the conference call. Now, they're saying they didn't plead guilty to that particular statement. That seems consistent because they're clarifying their guilty plea was for other things, not this one. So, 0, consistent.

Relevance: The response is directly answering the question about the cited evidence, so it's very relevant, 1.

Clarity: The response is clear, but they added ""I wished that was all I did,"" which might be a hedge. So, 2, slightly clear with hedging.

Outcome: The witness gave a response, so the outcome is Witness.

Reason: The main reason is that the witness is trying to attack credibility by suggesting they didn't do much, which is a credibility attack on the other side, so 2.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is somewhat truthful, consistent, relevant, and clear enough to show they're trying to downplay their role, which is a credibility issue.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as per the instructions.

First, the witness's commitment level. The question was about whether the witness was protecting themselves. The response was, ""I don't know what you mean by 'protecting' myself, but I don't feel that in the last three days I've protected myself in any way."" Hmm, the witness is saying they don't feel they've been protecting themselves. So, in terms of commitment, they're not showing any positive commitment to not being guilty. It's more neutral because they're just stating their feelings without any strong affirmation or denial. So I think this is a neutral commitment, which would be level 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is saying they don't feel they've been protecting themselves. The previous testimony mentioned that the witness knew about the incriminating evidence and even admitted to being guilty of aiding and abetting securities fraud. Now, the witness is saying they don't feel they've protected themselves. This seems contradictory because if they knew about the evidence, they might feel more pressure to protect themselves. But the witness is clarifying their feelings, so it's a bit of a confusing statement. However, it's not outright false; it's more of a clarification. So maybe it's somewhat truthful, but not entirely. I'm leaning towards not fully truthful, so perhaps a 0.

Consistency with previous testimony. In the previous exchange, the witness admitted to guilt and mentioned that they didn't plead guilty to the conference call statement. Now, they're saying they don't feel they've protected themselves. This seems to align with their previous statements because if they were guilty, they might not feel protected. So this is consistent with what they've said before. Therefore, consistency level is 0.

Response relevance. The witness is addressing the question about protection by explaining their feelings. This is directly relevant because it's answering the question asked. So relevance is very relevant, level 1.

Response clarity. The response is a bit vague. The witness is saying they don't feel they've protected themselves but don't elaborate. It's not very clear; it's more of a statement without much detail. So clarity level is 2, slightly clear with hedging.

Outcome value. The questioner is asking about protection, and the witness responds. So the outcome is a questioner turn, level 1.

Outcome reason. The witness is providing a response that seems to be a clarification, which might be seen as an emotional appeal because they're expressing their feelings about being protected. So the reason is emotional appeal/bias, level 1.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is somewhat inconsistent because their previous statements were more direct about guilt, but in this case, they're clarifying feelings. The truthfulness is questionable because they're not fully denying guilt but just explaining their current feelings. The relevance is high, clarity is low, commitment is neutral, and the outcome is a questioner turn with an emotional angle.

First, the commitment level. The question was about the value of the witness's assistance and cooperation. The witness responded by talking about staying on track and not avoiding questions. That sounds like they're trying to justify their cooperation, so maybe a neutral commitment. But I'm not sure if that's a 2 or 3.

Consistency: The previous testimony was about not avoiding questions and being guilty of aiding fraud. This response is similar, so it's consistent. Maybe a 0 because it's consistent.

Relevance: The response is about staying on track, which relates to cooperation but doesn't directly answer the question about incriminating evidence. So maybe slightly relevant, a 2.

Clarity: The response is a bit vague and uses ""The fullness"" which isn't clear. So maybe slightly unclear, a 3.

Outcome: The questioner is asking about the value of assistance, so the witness is responding, making the outcome a questioner turn. The reason could be logical arguments about cooperation, so maybe 1.

Putting it all together, the witness is somewhat committed, not very truthful, consistent, slightly relevant, unclear, and the outcome is the questioner with a logical argument.

DEFENSE: Might it also include how helpful you were to the cause of the Government?
","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question from the defense was about the Department's assessment of the value of the witness's assistance and cooperation. The witness responded with ""No."" I need to evaluate this response based on several criteria: commitment level, truthfulness, consistency, relevance, clarity, outcome, and the reason behind it.

Starting with commitment level. The question was about the value of assistance and cooperation, which is a positive aspect. So, the witness saying ""No"" might indicate a lack of commitment. But I'm not sure if it's detrimental or neutral. Since it's about the value, maybe it's neutral because it's not directly about helping or protecting the government. So, I think commitment level is 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness answered ""No"" without any hedging or explanation. If the question was about the value of their assistance, and they answered ""No,"" it's a straightforward answer. So, it's truthful, which is 1.

Consistency is next. The witness has given other answers in the transcript, like talking about their guilty plea and the e-mails. This ""No"" doesn't contradict those statements, so it's consistent, which is 0.

Relevance: The answer directly addresses the question about the value of assistance, so it's very relevant, which is 1.

Clarity: The response is very clear. There's no ambiguity or hedging, so clarity is 1.

Outcome: The witness responded with ""No,"" so the outcome is the witness's turn, which is 0.

Reason for the outcome: Since the witness answered directly and truthfully, it's probably a logical argument, which is 1.

Putting it all together, the witness's ""No"" is neutral in commitment, truthful, consistent, highly relevant, clear, and logically presented. So, the witness's response is strong in these areas.

```","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question from the defense was about the Department's assessment of the value of the witness's assistance and cooperation. The witness responded with ""No."" I need to evaluate this response based on several criteria: commitment level, truthfulness, consistency, relevance, clarity, outcome, and the reason behind it.

Starting with commitment level. The question was about the value of assistance and cooperation, which is a positive aspect. So, the witness saying ""No"" might indicate a lack of commitment. But I'm not sure if it's detrimental or neutral. Since it's about the value, maybe it's neutral because it's not directly about helping or protecting the government. So, I think commitment level is 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness answered ""No"" without any hedging or explanation. If the question was about the value of their assistance, and they answered ""No,"" it's a straightforward answer. So, it's truthful, which is 1.

Consistency is next. The witness has given other answers in the transcript, like talking about their guilty plea and the e-mails. This ""No"" doesn't contradict those statements, so it's consistent, which is 0.

Relevance: The answer directly addresses the question about the value of assistance, so it's very relevant, which is 1.

Clarity: The response is very clear. There's no ambiguity or hedging, so clarity is 1.

Outcome: The witness responded with ""No,"" so the outcome is the witness's turn, which is 0.

Reason for the outcome: Since the witness answered directly and truthfully, it's probably a logical argument, which is 1.

Putting it all together, the witness's ""No"" is neutral in commitment, truthful, consistent, highly relevant, clear, and logically presented. So, the witness's response is strong in these areas.",,3,1,0,1,1,Witness,1,0,0,0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,0.0,5.0,0.4,0.0,-0.6076903674611204,-1.0,0.6076903674611204

DEFENSE: Are you sure of that?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me go through each property one by one to understand how to assess the witness's statement.

First, the witness's response is: ""I'm sure of that, because I don't know that I will, by all means and everything I say, help the Government....""

1. **Commitment Level**: The witness is talking about the Department's assessment of their assistance. They mention staying on the right track and not avoiding questions, which seems positive. However, they end by saying they don't know if they'll help the Government. So, their commitment is neutral because they acknowledge uncertainty but also express a desire not to help, which might be a negative commitment. I think this is a 3 because it's neutral.

2. **Truthfulness**: The witness is stating that they don't know if they'll help the Government, which is a truthful statement. They're expressing uncertainty, so this is 1.

3. **Consistency**: Looking back at previous testimony, the witness mentioned aiding and abetting securities fraud and not pleading guilty to the conference call statement. Now, they're saying they don't know if they'll help the Government. This seems inconsistent because previously they admitted to aiding fraud but now is uncertain about their cooperation. So, this is a 1 for inconsistency.

4. **Relevance**: The response is directly addressing the question about the Department's assessment, so it's very relevant. That's a 1.

5. **Clarity**: The response is a bit vague, using phrases like ""don't know"" and ""everything I say."" It's slightly unclear because it hedges and doesn't provide a clear answer. So, this is a 2.

6. **Outcome**: The questioner is asking about the witness's commitment and their current response is about their uncertainty regarding helping the Government. So, the outcome is the Questioner because they're responding to the question.

7. **Reason for Outcome**: The witness is providing a truthful answer but is inconsistent with previous statements. The reason could be a credibility attack because the witness is contradicting themselves, which might undermine their credibility. So, this is 2.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is truthful but inconsistent and somewhat unclear. The questioner's point is making the witness uncertain about their cooperation, which could affect credibility.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as per the instructions.

First, the witness's commitment level. The question was about the age of the witness's children at the time they entered a plea of guilty. The witness answered, ""Two of them."" That seems pretty direct. It doesn't show any attempt to downplay the impact of the question. So, I think this is a beneficial commitment because the witness is directly addressing the question without any negative framing. So, commitment level is 2.

Next, truthfulness. The answer is ""Two of them."" That's a straightforward answer. It doesn't have any vague terms or self-contradictions. So, it's truthful. Truthfulness is 1.

Consistency with previous testimony. Looking back, the witness has given consistent answers in the past. For example, in the earlier parts, they mentioned their guilty plea and their age of children. So, this answer aligns with their previous statements. Consistency is 0.

Response relevance. The question was about the children's age, which is relevant to the case, especially if the children's age is a factor in determining parental responsibility or something similar. The answer is directly related, so relevance is very relevant, which is 1.

Response clarity. The answer is clear and direct. There's no ambiguity or hedging. It's straightforward, so clarity is 1.

Current turn outcome. The questioner is asking a question, so the outcome is ""Questioner.""

Outcome reason. The witness provided a clear and direct answer, which is relevant and truthful. There's no indication of any bias or emotional appeal. So, the reason is logical arguments are convincing, which is option 1.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is truthful, consistent, relevant, and clear. The questioner is asking the question, and the witness provided a straightforward answer. So, the witness's response is strong in these aspects.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as per the instructions.

First, the witness's commitment level. The question was about the defendant's fear of giving an answer that might alienate the Government. The witness answered, ""No."" I'm thinking about whether this shows a strong commitment. If the witness is saying ""No,"" it might indicate that they don't fear this negative impact, which could be a beneficial commitment. So I'm leaning towards a 2 for commitment level.

Next, truthfulness. The witness answered ""No"" to the question about fear. If they're telling the truth, that's straightforward. But sometimes witnesses might downplay fears to protect their image. However, in this case, ""No"" seems direct and honest, so I'll rate this as 1 for truthfulness.

For consistency, I need to check if this answer aligns with previous testimony. Looking back, the witness mentioned being afraid of giving answers that could affect their life due to government control. Now, they're saying they're not afraid. This seems contradictory because if they were afraid before, saying they're not now might be inconsistent. So I think this is inconsistent with previous statements, which would be a 1.

Regarding relevance, the answer directly addresses the question about fear, so it's very relevant. That's a 1.

Clarity-wise, the answer is straightforward. ""No"" is clear, but maybe there's a slight hedging if the witness is trying to avoid conflict. However, it's still pretty clear, so I'll give it a 2.

The outcome here is the witness answering, so the outcome value is ""Witness.""

For the reasons, the witness's answer directly addresses the fear, which could be seen as a credible denial or a way to avoid potential issues, which might be an emotional appeal or a credibility attack. But since it's a straightforward denial, maybe it's more of a logical argument. However, the fear aspect could be emotional, so I'll go with reason 3, emotional appeal.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is clear, somewhat consistent with previous statements (though contradictory), very relevant, and truthful. The outcome is the witness answering, possibly due to emotional appeal.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as instructed.

First, the witness commitment level. The question was about the children's ages, specifically asking how old the witness's three children were when he pled guilty. The witness responded, ""I'm past that.... If I can answer your earlier question, my children, two are in college and one in high school."" Hmm, this seems like an attempt to evade the question rather than providing a direct answer. So, I think this is a neutral commitment because the witness is avoiding the specific information requested without giving a clear ""no"" or refusing to answer.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is giving a response, but it's a bit vague and evasive. He's saying he can answer the earlier question but then giving information about his children's education. Since he's not directly answering the current question about the children's ages, it's not entirely truthful. So, I'd rate this as not truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony. Looking back at the transcript, the witness mentioned that two of his children were in college and one in high school when he entered a plea of guilty. This response is consistent with what he has said before, so the consistency value is consistent.

Response relevance. The witness is providing information about his children's current education, which is somewhat relevant because it relates to his past actions, but it's not directly answering the question about his age when he pled guilty. So, it's slightly relevant.

Response clarity. The response is a bit unclear because it's vague and indirect. He's not giving a straightforward answer but instead giving a reason to avoid answering the specific question. So, clarity is slightly unclear.

Current turn outcome. The witness is providing an answer, but it's not directly addressing the question. Instead, he's redirecting the question about his children. So, the outcome is the witness.

Reason for the outcome. The reason seems to be an attempt to avoid answering the question directly, which could be seen as an emotional appeal or a credibility attack on the government's side by showing he's evasive.

Putting it all together, the witness is evading the question, which might undermine his credibility. His response is vague and not directly answering the question, so it's slightly relevant but unclear. The outcome is that he's the one speaking, and the reason is likely an emotional appeal or a credibility issue.

The outcome is that he's the one speaking, and the reason is likely an emotional appeal or a credibility issue.","The witness is evading the question about his children's ages, which may undermine his credibility.",3,0,1,2,3,Witness,2,0,1,0,0.2,0.5,1.8,8.0,4.8,1.2687616393795076,1.8433274479653987,-0.1846238306359297,-0.5745658085858911
30,30,Q/A,I appreciate that.,"And entering into this guilty plea, it's not hard to tell them that. And I'm over the big fear.",enron_prosecution_1,"DEFENSE: Now, when you entered into this plea of guilty, had you been informed that there was a substantial amount of incriminating evidence against you?
P_WITNESS: I knew there - nobody had to have the other evidence. I knew it myself.

DEFENSE: Other than what you personally thought in your own mind, did someone show you any incriminating e-mails that showed that you were guilty?
P_WITNESS: I reviewed my conduct for many years after I left Enron as I was defending myself in the civil cases. Yes, I was guilty of aiding and abetting securities fraud....I didn't plead guilty to one statement on this conference call. That's not petty or whatever you called it – thin? I don't think it's thin or I wouldn't have pled guilty to it. You have three Q and A items there- No. That's not-

DEFENSE: -cited there.
P_WITNESS: They're cited here, yes. I wished that was all I did.

DEFENSE: So, back to my question, then. You're still in the mode of protecting yourself, aren't you?
P_WITNESS: I don't know what you mean by ""protecting"" myself, but I don't feel that in the last three days I've protected myself in any way.

DEFENSE: What does it mean to say ""the Department's assessment of the value of your assistance and your cooperation""?
P_WITNESS: The fullness. The – staying on the right track, not-not concentrating on little issues or avoiding the questions. I would put that in the value category.

DEFENSE: Might it also include how helpful you were to the cause of the Government?
P_WITNESS: No.

DEFENSE: Are you sure of that?
P_WITNESS: I'm sure of that, because I don't know that I will, by all means and everything I say, help the Government....

DEFENSE: And at the time you pled guilty, how old were your three children?
P_WITNESS: Two of them. . .

DEFENSE: Would you like to take a break, sir?
nan: nan

COURT: Why don't we take about a ten-minute break?
nan: nan

OTHERS: I'm fine. I'm fine…
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Are you afraid, sir, as you sit here now? Do you have a fear of giving an answer that might alienate the Government because of the control they have over the rest of your life?
P_WITNESS: No.

DEFENSE: You have no fear at all?
P_WITNESS: I'm past that....If I can answer your earlier question, my children, two are in college and one in high school.

DEFENSE: I appreciate that.
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as per the instructions.

1. **Witness Commitment Level**: The witness says, ""And entering into this guilty plea, it's not hard to tell them that. And I'm over the big fear."" The witness is talking about their own fear regarding the plea, but it's not clear if they're committed to the plea or expressing fear. The statement doesn't directly show a strong commitment to the plea; it's more about overcoming fear. So, I think this is a neutral commitment because they're expressing a personal feeling without necessarily committing more than before.

2. **Truthfulness**: The response seems straightforward. They're stating their feelings about the plea and overcoming fear. There's no indication of fibbing or inconsistencies here. So, I'd rate this as truthful.

3. **Consistency with Previous Testimony**: Looking back at the transcript, the witness has been consistent in explaining their guilty plea and their reasons, like being guilty of aiding and abetting securities fraud. They've also mentioned their children's education. This current statement doesn't contradict any previous testimony; it's just a follow-up on their feelings. So, this is consistent.

4. **Response Relevance**: The question was about the witness's commitment regarding the plea. The response directly addresses their feelings about the plea and overcoming fear, which is relevant to the question. It doesn't go off-topic, so it's very relevant.

5. **Response Clarity**: The response is clear. They're stating their feelings without using vague terms. They mention overcoming fear, which is a direct statement. So, clarity is very high here.

6. **Current Turn Outcome**: The questioner is asking about the witness's commitment, and the witness is responding. So, the outcome is the witness.

7. **Reason for Current Outcome**: The witness is providing a personal statement about their feelings and overcoming fear. There's no logical argument here; it's more of an emotional appeal, addressing their personal concern about the plea.

Putting it all together, the witness is consistent, truthful, and their response is both relevant and clear. The outcome is the witness's statement, which is an emotional appeal about overcoming fear regarding the plea.
